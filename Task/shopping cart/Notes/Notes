    // what are REACT HOOKS?
    // React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class.


    // why we name component in capital letter?
    // React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, <div> is a DOM tag, but <MyComponent> is a component. If you start a component name with a lowercase letter, React will not recognize it as a component and will treat it as a DOM tag instead.
    // This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in your application. By convention, React components should always start with a capital letter to avoid this confusion.
